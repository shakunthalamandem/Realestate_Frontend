      "The portfolio consists of 3 active properties totaling 328 units.",
      "Trailing NOI margin stands at a strong 60.21%, supported by controlled operating expenses (43.3% ratio).",
      "However, vacancy loss remains elevated at 11.64%, resulting in average occupancy of 88.3%.",
      "Gross Potential Rent is $9.57M (+10% YoY), generating $5.76M in NOI.",
      "Revenue per unit ($29,186) significantly exceeds expense per unit ($12,467), indicating healthy unit economics.",
    ],
    recommendations: [
      "Vacancy remains the key opportunity area, with 88.3% occupancy and 11.64% vacancy loss pressuring NOI; improving occupancy toward stabilized levels could meaningfully enhance earnings.",
      "Strong 10% YoY GPR growth supports selective rent optimization, particularly for below-market units.",
      "Operating expenses are well controlled at a 43.3% ratio, sustaining a healthy NOI margin while concessions should be reduced as leasing momentum improves.",
